###  Thinking of creating a project? Awesome! You've taken the first step. Now ask yourself:  
+  What problem are we trying to solve?  
+  Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from this project?  
+  Where can we find any research and data?  
+  What help is needed at this time? (ask this each step)  
+  What are the next steps to move the project along? (ask this each step)  

###  What project ideas have other cities thought of?
+  [Open Austin](https://github.com/open-austin/project-ideas/issues)  
+  [Code for San Jose](https://github.com/codeforsanjose/Project-Ideas/issues)  
+  [Code for Miami](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/project-ideas/issues)  
+  [OpenCity (Chicago)](http://opencityapps.org/)  
+  [Code for America: Brigade Projects](http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects)  

###  Are there existing projects on which we can collaborate or that we can fork?  
+  Basic github pages projects, like [Jlordâ€™s fork-n-go](http://jlord.us/forkngo/) and basic forking of repos a la [GitHub's Spoon-Knife repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)  
+  [Data related tasks, modifying data, cleaning data](http://www.dcode.fr/tools-list#data_processing)  
+  Do something with the data directly. For example: scraping, analysis, modeling, geospatial analysis, transformation
